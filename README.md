# SecureNet: Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview
**SecureNet** is a real-time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to monitor and analyze network traffic, detecting suspicious activities or malicious attacks. Leveraging machine learning, SecureNet identifies abnormal patterns and generates alerts for potential threats such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The system adheres to cybersecurity best practices, ensuring secure data transmission and a robust detection mechanism.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Network Traffic Monitoring
- **Packet Capture**: Monitor live network traffic by capturing data packets in real time using tools like Wireshark, Tcpdump, or libpcap.
- **Deep Packet Inspection**: Analyze captured packets for detailed information, such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and payloads.
- **Traffic Logging**: Store logs of network traffic for future analysis or forensic investigations.

### 2. Threat Detection with Signature and Anomaly-Based Methods
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Use a database of known attack signatures (e.g., malware hashes, malicious IP addresses) to detect common threats.
- **Anomaly-Based Detection**: Leverage machine learning to detect abnormal behavior in network traffic that deviates from the baseline (e.g., unusual data transfer volumes, atypical login attempts).
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models to detect zero-day attacks or unknown threats by identifying patterns of abnormal activity.

### 3. Intrusion Detection Alerts and Reporting
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Generate alerts when suspicious activity is detected (e.g., unauthorized access attempts, data breaches). Alerts can be sent via email or push notifications.
- **Threat Classification**: Classify detected intrusions by severity (low, medium, high), based on the type and potential impact of the threat.
- **Incident Reporting**: Automatically generate reports on detected threats, including details such as the time of detection, type of threat, and affected network segment.

### 4. Response Automation and Mitigation
- **Automatic Response**: When a severe intrusion is detected, the system can automatically trigger pre-defined mitigation actions such as blocking IP addresses, terminating suspicious sessions, or quarantining affected devices.
- **Manual Response**: Security administrators can manually take action through the system’s interface, such as isolating parts of the network or blacklisting IPs.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to automatically update the system with the latest threat signatures and blacklisted IPs.

### 5. Vulnerability Scanning and Risk Assessment
- **Network Vulnerability Scan**: Periodically scan the network to identify potential vulnerabilities (e.g., open ports, outdated software) that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Risk Scoring**: Assign a risk score to each vulnerability based on its severity, helping prioritize which vulnerabilities should be addressed first.
- **Patch Recommendation**: Provide recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities, such as installing software updates or reconfiguring security settings.

### 6. Secure Data Transmission and Storage
- **Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data, including traffic logs and threat reports, is encrypted during transmission and at rest.
- **Secure Communication Channels**: Use secure communication protocols like TLS to protect the system’s interaction with administrators and external servers.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data and system functionality based on the user’s role (e.g., admin, auditor).

### 7. Data Visualization Dashboard
- **Traffic Visualizations**: Provide real-time visualizations of network traffic, including traffic flow, volume by protocol, and geographic source of traffic.
- **Threat Maps**: Display an interactive threat map showing the source and destination of potential attacks, with details on their severity.
- **Historical Analysis**: Allow users to view historical trends in network traffic and threats, with options to filter by time, location, or severity of threats.

### 8. Machine Learning for Threat Detection
- **Training Data**: Use a labeled dataset of both normal and malicious network traffic to train machine learning models for anomaly detection.
- **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**: Implement both supervised models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for known attacks and unsupervised models (e.g., K-Means, Isolation Forest) for detecting unknown anomalies.
- **Continuous Learning**: Update the machine learning model with new data as the system runs, allowing it to learn from evolving threats.

### 9. Honeypot for Active Threat Detection
- **Honeypot Setup**: Deploy a honeypot to attract and monitor malicious actors by simulating vulnerable services.
- **Honeypot Monitoring**: Capture data on how attackers interact with the honeypot, which can be used to identify new attack patterns or signatures.
- **Threat Intel Generation**: Use insights from honeypot interactions to update threat databases and improve detection mechanisms.

### 10. API for Security Integration
- **REST API**: Provide an API for external systems to access SecureNet’s functionality, such as retrieving traffic logs, sending alerts to a SIEM, or integrating with a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform.
- **Custom Integration**: Allow security teams to customize the response actions and alerts by integrating with other enterprise systems (e.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems).
